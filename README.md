# spotify-artist-lookup

An Automator Workflow to quickly open Wikipedia page of currently-playing Spotify artist (not ultra-reliable but it's something). 

Current hotkey combo is cmd-shift-L, which is occasionally bound to the other app you're in. (e.g. the built-in text editor in this very website, I've just discovered.)

Can be modified to iTunes. 

Stolen largely from a Gizmodo comment.
Really.
